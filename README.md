This interactive Flutter app demonstrates a fun and meaningful use of the setState() method. It features a dynamic counter that:

ðŸ”¢ Increments with a button press

ðŸŽ¨ Changes background color randomly

ðŸ˜„ Displays different emojis based on the count

ðŸ”  Grows the text size with each tap

Each interaction updates the UI in real-time using setState(), helping reinforce how state changes trigger widget rebuilds in a visually engaging way.
